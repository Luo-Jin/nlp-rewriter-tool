Twenty state or territorial Democratic parties intend to apply to hold early presidential nominating contests in 2024, a DNC official told CNN Saturday, as the party reevaluates its process of selecting nominees.
The Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic National Committee, which is tasked with determining the party's nominating process, voted last month to open up an application process for states that want to hold contests early.The criteria the committee will consider revolve around diversity, competitiveness and the feasibility of holding an inclusive early contest.In recent cycles, four states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina -- have held the first contests on the presidential nominating calendar.
Those four state organizations joined 16 others in sending letters to the DNC before Friday's deadline, saying they intend to apply for one of the up-to-five slots for early contests.Iowa, which is largely White and voted for then-President Donald Trump by 8 points in 2020, has a complicated, time-consuming caucus system instead of a state-run primary and is expected to be most at risk of losing its early spot.
