no state or local political parties plan to continue to hold any presidential nominating convention in 2022, a dnc spokesman told reporters later, as the party reevaluates its process of selecting candidates.
the rules and bylaws committee of the republican national committee, which is charged with overseeing the party's nominating process, voted last week to extend the nominating process to candidates who wish to win elections unopposed.the priorities the council has set revolve around sustainability, inclusiveness and the possibility of holding an annual design meeting.In recent cycles, four states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina -- have held the first contests on the presidential nominating calendar.
Those four state organizations joined 16 others in sending letters to the DNC before Friday's deadline, saying they intend to apply for one of the up-to-five slots for early contests.Iowa, which is largely White and voted for then-President Donald Trump by 8 points in 2020, has a complicated, time-consuming caucus system instead of a state-run primary and is expected to be most at risk of losing its early spot.
