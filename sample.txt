One day, while the princess was playing with her gold ball it fell into the well. Because the well was so dark, the gold ball couldn't be seen. So, the princess sat down with a thud and began to cry. Just then, the ugly frog appeared.
"Why are you crying, princess?" "My gold ball fell into your well." "I will get your gold ball, if you let me stay and live by your side?" Even though she did not like the ugly frog, she wanted her gold ball back.
The princess thought that she was the most beautiful person in the world. So she disliked anything that was ugly and only liked what looked pretty and tasted good.The princess who had no friends always played alone on the palace lawn with her ball. "If only I had a friend to play with this ball, how nice it would be." Since she was so lonely she talked to herself. "Play ball with me."
